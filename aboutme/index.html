    <h2>Nara Inspired</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, I am Edem Offiong. i'm from Cross river state in the southern part of Nigeria.  I am enrolled into BYU-Idaho to get a Bachelors degree in software development. <br> I am mostly an introvert although i do have my extrovert moments once every blue moon lol. I enjoy swimming, seeing movies and listening to music in my spare time,<br> when i'm not doing any of these things i'm sure to be caught surfing the internet for some new knowledge.</p>
    <p> I am single and i currently live and work at a hospital in eket. What i love the most about BYU-Idaho is the flexible nature of the online degree which i'm running <br>especially as someone who has a 9-5 job on mondays to saturdays. What i love the most about a career in web design and development is my ability to work remotely, <br>this is so suitable for me as someone who even though i enjoy working in a team, i function best on my personal PC on my desk at home. i hope to study well enough <br>to get a breakthrough sooner than later with hopes of switching into the tech industry fully.  </p>
<p>I look forward to getting to know you all as my colleagues. Thank you for being my audience.</p>
