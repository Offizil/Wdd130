                <h3>History of carnival</h3>
                <p>What is the history of carnival? My fellow carnival lovers, many of you may not know that the beginnings of carnival are thought to have started in Africa! <br>That’s right many, believe that carnival began some 5000 years ago in Egypt and Sumeria. Carnival was celebrated by many pagans societies across the <br>world and was even adopted by the Roman Empire which spread it across the world. It was again adopted by the Catholic Church and the <br>celebrations spread even further to the Americas and even as far as India. It’s hard to believe that this global phenomenon celebrated in over 52 countries had its <br>humble beginnings in Africa.</p>

                <h3>What is the History of Calabar Carnival</h3>
                <p>The origins of Calabar Carnival started back in 2004 when Donald Duke the governor of Cross River, Nigeria, decided it would be the perfect way to boost <br>tourism and the local economy. He wanted to turn Cross River State into the number one tourist destination for Nigerians. He wanted to create a carnival <br>festival that would heavily showcase the local heritage and the Calabar Carnival was a wild success! Today the carnival attracts millions of visitors <br>throughout the entire month of December and has given the local economy a huge boost. Ironically the biggest and best carnival in Africa, the birthplace of <br>carnival, is actually one of the youngest carnivals in the world. No doubt this carnival festival will be a huge part of the history of Calabar.</p>
